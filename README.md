# CerealNetwork

A decentralized, fault-tolerant platform for coordinating community food sharing locations. Mycelium Network provides real-time inventory visibility for community fridges, little free pantries, and food distribution points, enabling efficient resource allocation and reducing food waste.

## üéØ The Problem

Community food sharing initiatives face critical coordination challenges:
- **Inefficient distribution**: Donors lack visibility into what supplies are needed where
- **Wasted resources**: Volunteers spend time checking locations that are already stocked
- **Information gaps**: People in need travel to empty distribution points
- **Centralized failure points**: Existing solutions rely on single servers that can fail

## üí° Our Solution

Mycelium Network creates a resilient, community-owned coordination system that:
- **Tracks real-time inventory** across all connected food sharing locations
- **Provides multiple access points** via web app and SMS for maximum accessibility
- **Uses decentralized technology** to ensure system resilience and community ownership
- **Implements consensus mechanisms** to maintain data accuracy without central authority
